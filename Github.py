print("\nIt is unknown when cheese was first made.\nThe earliest direct evidence for cheesemaking has been found in excavated clay sieves (holed pottery) dated to be over seven thousand years old;\nFor example in Kujawy, Poland, and the Dalmatian coast in Croatia, the latter with dried remains which chemical analysis suggests was cheese.\nShards of holed pottery were also found in Urnfield pile-dwellings on Lake Neuchatel in Switzerland and are hypothesized to be cheese-strainers;\nthey date back to roughly eight thousand years ago.\nFor preservation purposes, cheese-making may have begun by the pressing and salting of curdled milk.\nAnimal skins and inflated internal organs already provided storage vessels for a range of foodstuffs.\nCurdling milk in an animal's stomach made solid and better-textured curds when compared to other traditional storage methods, such as clay jars. "
      "\nHard salted cheese is likely to have accompanied dairying from the outset as it is the only form in which milk can be kept in a hot climate.\nDairying existed around 4,000 BC in the grasslands of the Sahara.\nCheese produced in Europe, where climates are cooler than in the Middle East, required less salt for preservation.\nWith less salt and acidity, the cheese became a suitable environment for useful microbes and molds, giving aged cheeses their pronounced and interesting flavors.")

print("\nThe Ancient Greeks made pancakes called τηγανίτης (tēganitēs), ταγηνίτης (tagēnitēs) or ταγηνίας (tagēnias), all words deriving from τάγηνον (tagēnon), \"frying pan\".\nThe earliest attested references to tagenias are in the works of the 5th-century BC poets Cratinus and Magnes.\nTagenites were made with wheat flour, olive oil, honey, and curdled milk, and were served for breakfast.\nAnother kind of pancake was σταιτίτης (staititēs), from σταίτινος (staitinos), \"of flour or dough of spelt\", derived from σταῖς (stais), \"flour of spelt\".\nAthenaeus mentions, in his Deipnosophistae, staititas topped with honey, sesame, and cheese.\nThe Middle English word pancake appears in English in the 15th century.\nThe Ancient Romans called their fried concoctions alia dulcia, Latin for \"other sweets\".\nThese were much different from what are known as pancakes today.")

print("In ancient times, the Greeks cooked flat cakes, called obelios, between hot metal plates.\nAs they spread throughout medieval Europe, the cakes—made from a mixture of flour, water or milk, and often eggs—became known as wafers and were also cooked over an open fire between iron plates with long handles.\nRound metal plate decorated with raised pattern of flowers, vines, and leaves.\nWaffles are preceded, in the early Middle Ages, around the period of the 9th–10th centuries, with the simultaneous emergence of fer à hosties / hostieijzers (communion wafer irons) and moule à oublies (wafer irons).\nWhile the communion wafer irons typically depicted imagery of Jesus and his crucifixion, the moule à oublies featured more trivial Biblical scenes or simple, emblematic designs.\nThe format of the iron itself was almost always round and considerably larger than those used for communion.\nThe oublie was, in its basic form, composed only of grain flour and water—just as the communion wafer was.\nIt took until the 11th century, when the Crusades brought new culinary ingredients to Western Europe, for flavorings such as orange blossom water to be added to oublies; however, locally sourced honey and other flavorings may have already been in use before that time.\nOublies spread throughout northwestern continental Europe.\nTheir spread eventually led to the formation of the oublieurs guild in 1270.\nOublieurs/obloyers were responsible for producing not only oublies but also a number of other contemporaneous and subsequent pâtisseries légères (light pastries), including the waffles that were soon to arise.")
