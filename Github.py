print("\nIt is unknown when cheese was first made.\nThe earliest direct evidence for cheesemaking has been found in excavated clay sieves (holed pottery) dated to be over seven thousand years old;\nFor example in Kujawy, Poland, and the Dalmatian coast in Croatia, the latter with dried remains which chemical analysis suggests was cheese.\nShards of holed pottery were also found in Urnfield pile-dwellings on Lake Neuchatel in Switzerland and are hypothesized to be cheese-strainers;\nthey date back to roughly eight thousand years ago.\nFor preservation purposes, cheese-making may have begun by the pressing and salting of curdled milk.\nAnimal skins and inflated internal organs already provided storage vessels for a range of foodstuffs.\nCurdling milk in an animal's stomach made solid and better-textured curds when compared to other traditional storage methods, such as clay jars. "
      "\nHard salted cheese is likely to have accompanied dairying from the outset as it is the only form in which milk can be kept in a hot climate.\nDairying existed around 4,000 BC in the grasslands of the Sahara.\nCheese produced in Europe, where climates are cooler than in the Middle East, required less salt for preservation.\nWith less salt and acidity, the cheese became a suitable environment for useful microbes and molds, giving aged cheeses their pronounced and interesting flavors.")
